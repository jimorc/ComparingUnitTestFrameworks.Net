# ComparingUnitTestFrameworks.Net
This repository contains the code discussed in my post [https://jaipblog.wordpress.com/2017/08/11/comparing-net-unit-test-frameworks/ (Comparing .Net Unit Test Frameworks)].

There are four projects:
- PlayingCards: contains a simple class called CardSuit for which the unit tests are written.
- MSTestTests - unit tests written for MSTest.
- NUnitTests - unit tests written for NUnit.
- xUnitTests - unit tests written for xUnit.Net.

## Requirements
1. Visual Studio 2017 Update 1 or later (any version)
2. .Net 4.61 (comes with VS 2017)
3. nuget packages for NUnit and xUnit.Net. These should load automatically when you first try to build the solution.

Again, see the post mentioned above about the various tests.
